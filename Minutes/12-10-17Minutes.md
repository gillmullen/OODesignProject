# 12/10/17 Minutes

* Secretary: Gillian Mullen
* Attendees: Gillian Mullen, Sarah Curran, Yvonne Murphy, Tom Doyle, Ciara Godwin
* Absent: N/A


## Agenda Items:
* Primary class list- Couldn’t come up with more.
* Minutes - Format before submitting. Dates and members present.
* Class diagrams, use cases and structured walkthrough need to be done.
* Submission 1 is next Friday
* Refined Requirements Spec seems to be a lot of work. 1 page and a half should be fine.
* Over two terminals can be done, since it’s just client-server
* Meet up early next week because deadline and again Thursday. More of updates than full meetings. Time: After Algorithms lab on Monday @ 12.30, again at Thursday @ 2.


## Decisions:
* Documentation in Markdown -> easy to convert to PDF. Good practice for 3rd year project.
* More scenarios?- Branch out scenarios, Log on -> initiates game against player or AI, take into account errors.
* Choosing a username each time would be easier than making an account
* Use case has template. About 5 diagrams to match.
* Going with UMLet? Runs off Java. Violet seems better to use, without having code to base it off.
* Regular meeting time now Thursday at 2 because all members are free


## Actions:
* **Everyone**: Fork the git repo and add name to contributors in readme, make pull request
* **Ciara** - Combine scenarios in github once everyone has uploaded theirs, and structured walkthrough
* **Everyone**- Use Cases & Diagrams
* **Tom**- Class diagram, use Violet as agreed
* **Gillian**- Minutes, tidy up and create dir on github
* **Use Cases**- User logs on @Sarah, user makes move @Yvonne, user wins the game @Gillian, player leaves the game @Tom, player tries to make an illegal move @Ciara. Template is in notes, make diagram in Violet
