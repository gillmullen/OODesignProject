## 5/10/17 Minutes

* Secretary: Gillian Mullen
* Attendees: Gillian Mullen, Sarah Curran, Yvonne Murphy, Tom Doyle, Ciara Godwin
* Absent: N/A


## Agenda Items:
#### Clarification of Project:
1. Questions & Ambiguities- Can the game be played on the terminal?
2. Elements requiring network programming- Communication between player and programme
3. Elements with graphic image manipulation- Board, players, pieces, animation?
4. Played on terminal - no animation
5. Elements with audio- Illegal move, capturing pieces, game over
6. Elements with algorithms- Search tree with computer AI. Green dot showing where you can move. Don’t let players make illegal moves


## Decisions:
* Language: Java vs Python. Python is easier: command line and networking
* Scenarios: user stories, very specific
* Aim towards beginners, 9x9 board


## Deliverables:
* Create gitlab repo
* Inverstigate UMLet
* Key classes- Board, Pieces, Players/Users, Connection
