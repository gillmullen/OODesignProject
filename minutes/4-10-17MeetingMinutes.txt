Secretary: Gillian Mullen
Attendees: Gillian Mullen, Sarah Curran, Tom Doyle, Ciara Godwin
Absent: Yvonne Murphy


Agenda Items:
Points about the game: There are not many good Go AIs. We want to create a player vs player version, not a version that implements AI. Should we make this game run through the command line? It is doable, rather than using a UI. 8% Implementation out of 25%, so it needs to be implemented to demo, a half done game can’t be demoed.
Points about the Project as a whole: Internet based, done over client server. Recommends Python, to do network stuff. AI optional. Language: No specific language, focus on UML. UML: UMLet
Changes to game: Speed game up, make choices in fifteen seconds - games last five minutes. Maybe limit turns
Basic Requirements: Black and White pieces, 2nd turn white. Board size - 9x9, 13x13, 19x19. Ko- can’t go in an infinite loop, illegal moves. One counter place at time. White gets 0.5 for going second to stop ties, 6.5 for handicap
